# Sleeping-TA
A university computer science department has a teaching assistant (TA) whohelps undergraduate students with their programming assignments duringregular office hours. The TAâ€™s office is rather small and has room for only one desk with a chair and computer. There are three chairs in the hallway outsidethe office where students can sit and wait if the TA is currently helping anotherstudent. When there are no students who need help during office hours, the TA sits at the desk and takes a nap. If a student arrives during office hoursand finds the TA sleeping, the student must awaken the TA to ask for help. If astudent arrives and finds the TA currently helping another student, the student sits on one of the chairs in the hallway and waits. If no chairs are available, thestudent will come back at a later time. Using POSIX threads, mutex locks, and semaphores, implement a solutionthat coordinates the activities of the TA and the students.
